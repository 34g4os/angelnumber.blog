## Does cubed mean 2 or 3?
The symbol for cubed is 3. For example, 8 is a cube number because it's 2 x 2 x 2 (2 multiplied by itself twice); this is also written as 23 (“two cubed”). Another example of a cube number is 27 because it's 33 (3 x 3 x 3, or “three cubed”). A cube number can also be called a number cubed.

## What is meant by squaring and cubing a number?
