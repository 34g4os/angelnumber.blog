## What is an open circle on a number line?
Inequalities can be shown on a number line. Open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (< or >). Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ or ≥).

## Is the circle open or closed on a number line?
When graphing a linear inequality on a number line, use an open circle for "less than" or "greater than", and a closed circle for "less than or equal to" or "greater than or equal to".

## What does a hollow dot mean on a number line?
When graphing inequalities involving real numbers, lines, rays, and dots are used. A dot is used if the number is included. A hollow dot is used if the number is not included.

## What symbol is an open circle?
A closed, or shaded, circle is used to represent the inequalities greater than or equal to (≥) or less than or equal to (≤) . The end point is part of the solution. An open circle is used for greater than (>) or less than (<).

## What does an open circle on a number line mean?
Inequalities can be shown on a number line. Open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (< or >). Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ or ≥).

## What does an open dot mean?
We use the open and closed dots to make this distinction. I put a closed dot at the "5" end of the interval to indicate that x = 5 satisfies the inequality, and I put an open dot at the "1" end of the interval to indicate that x = 1 does not satisfy the inequality.

## When the circle is closed on a number line?
Explanation: A closed circle indicates "greater than or equal to" or "less than or equal to," while and open circle indicates "greater than" or "less than".

## Is circle open or line open?
IEC 60417-5008, the power-off symbol (circle) on a button or toggle, indicates that using the control will disconnect power to the device. (0 or ◯ means off.) IEC 60417-5009, the standby symbol (line partially within a broken circle), indicates a sleep mode or low power state.

## Is a circle closed?
A circle is a closed shape with no sides, no vertices, and one face.

## What does a hollow circle mean in math on a number line?
Full circle means we include the number: X ≥ 3 This means X can be 3 OR greater. Hollow circle means we do NOT include the number: X > 3 This means X can ONLY be greater than 3.

## When the circle is closed on a number line?
Explanation: A closed circle indicates "greater than or equal to" or "less than or equal to," while and open circle indicates "greater than" or "less than".

## What does a hollow circle mean in math on a number line?
Full circle means we include the number: X ≥ 3 This means X can be 3 OR greater. Hollow circle means we do NOT include the number: X > 3 This means X can ONLY be greater than 3.

## What represents an open circle?
A closed circle indicates "greater than or equal to" or "less than or equal to," while and open circle indicates "greater than" or "less than".

## What is the circle symbol in math?
symbol Ο

## What does ○ mean in math?
The circle ∘ is the symbol for composition of functions. In General, if you have two functions g:X→Y and f:Y→Z, then f∘g is a function from X to Z. For x∈X one has (f∘g)(x)=f(g(x)).

## What does an empty dot on a number line mean?
A solid dot on a number line graph indicates that the given number should be included as a possible solution, whereas an open dot indicates that the given number cannot be a solution. For example, if you graph x > 7, you place an open dot at 7 because it's not a valid answer (7 is not greater than itself).

## What does a hollow circle mean in math on a number line?
Full circle means we include the number: X ≥ 3 This means X can be 3 OR greater. Hollow circle means we do NOT include the number: X > 3 This means X can ONLY be greater than 3.

## What does a shaded dot mean in math?
Graphing Inequalities in One Variable If the inequality is "strict" ( < or > ), we use an open dot to indicate that the endpoint of the ray is not part of the solution. For the other types of inequalities ( ≤ and ≥ ), we use a closed dot to indicate that the endpoint is part of the solution.
