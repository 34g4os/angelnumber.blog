## How do you know if it's an open or closed circle?
Open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (< or >). Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ or ≥).

## Is open dot or closed dot?
Functions and Graphs On a graph, a solid dot is used for a closed endpoint and a hollow dot is used for an open endpoint.Feb 12, 2012

## What does it mean when a dot is open?
A solid dot on a number line graph indicates that the given number should be included as a possible solution, whereas an open dot indicates that the given number cannot be a solution. For example, if you graph x > 7, you place an open dot at 7 because it's not a valid answer (7 is not greater than itself).

## What does open or closed dot mean on a line graph?
1) Draw a number line. 2) Put either an open circle or a closed dot above the number given. For ≤ and ≥ , use a closed dot to indicate the number itself is part of the solution. For < and >, use an open circle to indicate the number itself is not part of the solution.

## What does a hollow circle mean in a number line?
When using a number line, a small solid circle is used for ≤ or ≥ and a hollow circle is used for > or <. For example, x ≥ 5. Here the solid circle means that the value 5 is included.

## What does a hollow circle mean in math graph?
A hollow circle means a discontinuity caused by a specific point being taken off the graph. It could mean a removable discontinuity, or it could mean that the interval is open instead of closed.Aug 14, 2016

## What does a hollow circle represent on the number line of a rational inequality?
Explanation: A closed circle indicates "greater than or equal to" or "less than or equal to," while and open circle indicates "greater than" or "less than".

## What is a closed dot on a number line?
Explanation: A closed circle indicates "greater than or equal to" or "less than or equal to," while and open circle indicates "greater than" or "less than".

## What is a closed dot on a number line?
Explanation: A closed circle indicates "greater than or equal to" or "less than or equal to," while and open circle indicates "greater than" or "less than".

## What is a closed dot on a number line?
Explanation: A closed circle indicates "greater than or equal to" or "less than or equal to," while and open circle indicates "greater than" or "less than".
