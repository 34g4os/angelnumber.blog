## Can I use 10w30 instead of 5w30 in winter?
Although both 5w30 and 10w30 are multi-grade, the latter thins enough when living in an area with extremely low temperatures. This makes it perform much better during the winter season than 10w30. 10w30, on the other hand, will flow effectively in hot summers or higher temperatures.Apr 16, 2022

## Is 10w30 OK for winter?
10W30 vs 10W40 Oil FAQs 10W-30 motor oil is recommended for ambient temperatures not exceeding -30°C/-22°F in the winter or 35°C/95°F in the summer. This is a great motor oil to use if you live in Canada or cooler U.S. states. Colder regions would require 5W-20, while hotter regions may call for 10W-40.

## What oil is best for winter driving?
The Bottom Line A multi-viscosity 5W30 oil flows quicker in cold weather and is recommended for year-round protection, and a synthetic 5W30 multi-viscosity will provide the best protection you can get in both extremely cold weather and extremely hot engine temperatures.

## Will it hurt to run 5w30 instead of 10w30?
Can you use 5W-30 instead of 10W-30? Absolutely yes for car engines, 5W-30 is usually synthetic and superior to 10W-30. Both have the same viscosity at the operating temperature of an average car engine. 5W has lower viscosity when cool and is considered better for the car engine during engine start.

## What happens if you use 5w30 instead of 10w30?
So both the oils 5W–30 and 10W–30 have exactly the same viscosity (SAE 30) when your engine is running, and will perform in the same way. However, the 10W–30 oil will be thicker (higher viscosity) than the 5W–30 when it is cool.

## Is it better to use 5w30 or 10w30?
Lubrication. 5w30 provides better lubrication compared to 10w30. It is best suited for private vehicles and light-duty diesel and petrol engines, while 10w30 is more suitable for commercial vehicles and other cars with heavy load engines.Apr 16, 2022
