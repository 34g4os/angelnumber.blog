## What is an expression of more than two algebraic terms especially the sum of several terms that contain different powers of the same variable s?
Definition of polynomial from google's search engine dictionary: an expression of more than two algebraic terms, especially the sum of several terms that contain different powers of the same variable(s).Jun 12, 2018

## What is the name for an algebraic expression that is the sum or difference of two terms?
In general, an expression with one or more than one term (with non- negative integral exponents of the variables) is called a 'Polynomial'. The sum (or difference) of two like terms is a like term with coefficient equal to the sum (or difference) of coefficients of the two like terms.

## What do you call to an algebraic expression with two terms?
Binomial: An algebraic expression containing two terms is called a binomial.

## What is an expression with multiple terms called?
(i) Any expression with one or more terms is called a Polynomial. (ii) Terms which have the same algebraic factors are like terms. (iii) The coefficient is the numerical factor in the term. (iv) Algebraic expressions are formed from variables and constants.

## What is like and unlike terms in algebra?
Ans: In an algebraic expression, if the variables are the same despite different coefficients and the exponents being the same, those terms are known as like terms. Whereas, if the expression consists of two different variables or different exponents or coefficients, those expressions are known as, unlike terms.

## What are like and unlike terms give examples?
Like terms : The terms having the same literal (variable) with same exponents are called Like terms. Example: 1) 12x and -5x 2) 4x2 and ½ x2. Unlike terms : The terms having the same variable with different exponents or different variable with same exponents are called Unlike terms. Example : 1) 5x and 5y 2) 2x2 and 3y ...

## What is an expression with 3 terms?
∙ An algebraic Expression containing three terms is trinomial.

## What is an expression with multiple terms called?
(i) Any expression with one or more terms is called a Polynomial. (ii) Terms which have the same algebraic factors are like terms. (iii) The coefficient is the numerical factor in the term. (iv) Algebraic expressions are formed from variables and constants.

## Can you add 2 unlike terms?
The sum of two or more like terms is a single like term; but the two unlike terms cannot be added together to get a single term.

## What is an expression with many terms called?
You call an expression with a single term a monomial, an expression with two terms is a binomial, and an expression with three terms is a trinomial. An expression with more than three terms is named simply by its number of terms. For example a polynomial with five terms is called a five-term polynomial.May 27, 2022

## What is a multi term expression?
Multiword expressions (MWEs) are expressions which are made up of at least 2 words and which can be syntactically and/or semantically idiosyncratic in nature. Moreover, they act as a single unit at some level of linguistic analysis.Jun 25, 2012

## What's an expression with 3 terms?
Trinomial: An algebraic expression containing three terms is called a trinomial.

## What is an expression with one or more terms called?
(i) Any expression with one or more terms is called a Polynomial.

## What is an expression with three term?
You call an expression with a single term a monomial, an expression with two terms is a binomial, and an expression with three terms is a trinomial. An expression with more than three terms is named simply by its number of terms. For example a polynomial with five terms is called a five-term polynomial.Aug 25, 2017

## What kind of expression is 3x?
single terms

## What are some examples of an algebraic expression?
An algebraic expression is a mathematical phrase where variables and constants are combined using the operational (+, -, × & ÷) symbols. An algebraic symbol lacks the equal (=) sign. For example, 10x + 63 and 5x – 3 are examples of algebraic expressions.Nov 28, 2020

## What are three examples of algebraic?
5x, x + y, x-3 and more are examples of algebraic expression. A constant is any set of numbers. A variable is a letter used to represent an unknown value. In solving an algebraic expression, simply combine like terms.

## What are the 5 algebraic expressions?
Types of algebraic expressions may further be distinguished in the following five categories. They are: monomial, polynomial, binomial, trinomial, multinomial.

## What is an example of a algebraic expression?
Algebraic expressions include at least one variable and at least one operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). For example, 2(x + 8y) is an algebraic expression.

## How do you write an expression?
We write an expression in math by using numbers or variables and mathematical operators which are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, the expression of the mathematical statement "4 added to 2", will be 2+4.

## Does an expression have 3 terms?
Trinomial: An algebraic expression containing three terms is called a trinomial.

## What are 3 terms called in math?
Trinomial: An algebraic expression of three non-zero terms only is called a trinomial. Examples of trinomial: x + y + z is a trinomial in three variables x, y and z.

## What is an expression with 3 terms called?
∙ An algebraic Expression containing two terms is binomial. ∙ An algebraic Expression containing three terms is trinomial.

## What are unlike terms in algebraic expression?
What are Unlike Terms? Algebraic terms, which does not have the same literal coefficients, and cannot be raised to the same power are called, unlike terms. For example, 4x + 9y is an algebraic expression with unlike terms. Because it has two different variables x and y, and not raised to the same power.

## Can you multiple unlike terms?
A mathematical operation of multiplying two or more unlike algebraic terms is called the multiplication of unlike algebraic terms.
