## Can you trace an unavailable number?
Can I trace unknown, blocked, or private numbers? Private numbers, blocked, and restricted calls can usually be traced. However, unknown, unavailable or out of area calls are not traceable because they don't contain the data needed for a successful trace.

## Who is calling me from an unavailable number?
This feature typically generates a "Restricted" identification on the receiver's end, but it can also be identified as "Unknown" or "Unknown Caller." Phone calls that show up as "Unavailable" are the result of your phone carrier's inability to identify a caller's number.

## Is there a way to find out who is calling blocked?
With TrapCall, you can unmask these blocked numbers and find out exactly who's calling you from No Caller ID. That means their phone number, name, and even their address. Plus, with TrapCall you can even blacklist the unmasked phone number to prevent them from continuing to harass you.Sep 21, 2017

three eighth-notes

## What does the 8 mean in 7/8 time signature?
7/8 time contains two simple beats and one compound beat. Again, the order of the beats does not matter. The compound beat can even be positioned between two simple beats. 8/8 time contains two compound beats and one simple beat. Sometimes, people confuse 8/8 with 4/4, since both have 8 eighth notes.
