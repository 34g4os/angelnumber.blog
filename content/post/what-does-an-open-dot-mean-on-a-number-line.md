## Is open dot or closed dot?
Functions and Graphs On a graph, a solid dot is used for a closed endpoint and a hollow dot is used for an open endpoint.Feb 12, 2012

## What does open or closed dot mean on a line graph?
1) Draw a number line. 2) Put either an open circle or a closed dot above the number given. For ≤ and ≥ , use a closed dot to indicate the number itself is part of the solution. For < and >, use an open circle to indicate the number itself is not part of the solution.

## What do open and closed dots mean on a graph?
Explanation: An open circle indictes "less than" or "greater than," while a closed circle indicates "greater than or equal to" or "less than or equal to".

## What does a closed dot mean on a line graph?
1) Draw a number line. 2) Put either an open circle or a closed dot above the number given. For ≤ and ≥ , use a closed dot to indicate the number itself is part of the solution. For < and >, use an open circle to indicate the number itself is not part of the solution.

## What is the difference between open and closed circles on a line graph?
Inequalities on a number line Inequalities can be shown on a number line. Open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (< or >). Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ or ≥).

## What does open and close dot mean?
We use the open and closed dots to make this distinction. I put a closed dot at the "5" end of the interval to indicate that x = 5 satisfies the inequality, and I put an open dot at the "1" end of the interval to indicate that x = 1 does not satisfy the inequality.

## How do you know if it is an open or closed circle?
Open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (< or >). Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ or ≥).

## What does open dot mean on a graph?
A solid dot on a number line graph indicates that the given number should be included as a possible solution, whereas an open dot indicates that the given number cannot be a solution. For example, if you graph x > 7, you place an open dot at 7 because it's not a valid answer (7 is not greater than itself).

## How do you know if it is an open or closed circle?
Open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (< or >). Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ or ≥).

## What does open dot mean on a graph?
A solid dot on a number line graph indicates that the given number should be included as a possible solution, whereas an open dot indicates that the given number cannot be a solution. For example, if you graph x > 7, you place an open dot at 7 because it's not a valid answer (7 is not greater than itself).

## What does an open dot on a number line mean?
A solid dot on a number line graph indicates that the given number should be included as a possible solution, whereas an open dot indicates that the given number cannot be a solution. For example, if you graph x > 7, you place an open dot at 7 because it's not a valid answer (7 is not greater than itself).

## What does a shaded circle mean on a number line?
Representing Inequalities on a Number Line Each of these graphs begins with a circle—either an open or closed (shaded) circle. This point is often called the end point of the solution. A closed, or shaded, circle is used to represent the inequalities greater than or equal to ( ) or less than or equal to ( ).

## What does an open dot on a number line mean?
A solid dot on a number line graph indicates that the given number should be included as a possible solution, whereas an open dot indicates that the given number cannot be a solution. For example, if you graph x > 7, you place an open dot at 7 because it's not a valid answer (7 is not greater than itself).

## What does a shaded circle mean on a number line?
Representing Inequalities on a Number Line Each of these graphs begins with a circle—either an open or closed (shaded) circle. This point is often called the end point of the solution. A closed, or shaded, circle is used to represent the inequalities greater than or equal to ( ) or less than or equal to ( ).

## What is dot empty?
The Department of Transportation (DOT), for the purposes of hazardous materials transportation, has a more stringent definition. A container that once held a hazardous material is considered empty when it has been sufficiently cleaned of residue and purged of vapor.Nov 2, 2015

## What does an open dot mean?
We use the open and closed dots to make this distinction. I put a closed dot at the "5" end of the interval to indicate that x = 5 satisfies the inequality, and I put an open dot at the "1" end of the interval to indicate that x = 1 does not satisfy the inequality.
