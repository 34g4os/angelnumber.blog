## How do you solve an equation with parentheses?
If an equation you need to solve has parentheses, simplify the parentheses (most often using distribution) and then solve as you normally would. Simplify both sides of the equation as much as possible using the order of operations (distribute, combine like terms, etc.).Jan 21, 2019

## What does a number in a parenthesis mean?
It means the number is negative. It's an alternate way of showing negative numbers versus prefacing with a negative sign ( - ) In some cases, a negative value also has a different name. For example you'll often see Net Profit (Loss) : (10,000) Where the parentheses means that it was a loss and not a profit.Feb 14, 2019

## What does an unfilled circle mean on a number line?
Inequalities can be shown on a number line. Open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (< or >). Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ or ≥).

## What does it mean when the dot on the number line is filled in?
A solid dot on a number line graph indicates that the given number should be included as a possible solution, whereas an open dot indicates that the given number cannot be a solution. For example, if you graph x > 7, you place an open dot at 7 because it's not a valid answer (7 is not greater than itself).

## What does a hollow point on a graph mean?
A solid dot on a line indicates that the line goes through that point. A hollow dot on a line indicates that the line is not defined at that point.Aug 14, 2016

## Is an open circle undefined?
The open circle does mean the function is undefined at that particular x-value. However, limits do not care what is actually going on at the value.

## What does an empty circle mean on a number line?
Inequalities on a number line Inequalities can be shown on a number line. Open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (< or >). Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ or ≥).

## What does it mean when the dot on the number line is not filled in?
A solid dot on a number line graph indicates that the given number should be included as a possible solution, whereas an open dot indicates that the given number cannot be a solution. For example, if you graph x > 7, you place an open dot at 7 because it's not a valid answer (7 is not greater than itself).

## What does a not filled in circle mean on a graph?
A filled circle is used for "less than or equal to" and for "greater than or equal to". An open circle is used for "less than" and for "greater than". FYI...

## What is the difference in meaning between a dot and an empty circle on a number line graph?
2) Put either an open circle or a closed dot above the number given. For ≤ and ≥ , use a closed dot to indicate the number itself is part of the solution. For < and >, use an open circle to indicate the number itself is not part of the solution.

## What does a shaded dot mean in math?
Graphing Inequalities in One Variable If the inequality is "strict" ( < or > ), we use an open dot to indicate that the endpoint of the ray is not part of the solution. For the other types of inequalities ( ≤ and ≥ ), we use a closed dot to indicate that the endpoint is part of the solution.

## What does it mean if the circle is empty on a number line?
Inequalities can be shown on a number line. Open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (< or >). Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ or ≥).

## What does a not filled in circle mean on a graph?
A filled circle is used for "less than or equal to" and for "greater than or equal to". An open circle is used for "less than" and for "greater than". FYI...

## What does a closed circle on a number line mean?
Inequalities on a number line Inequalities can be shown on a number line. Open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (< or >). Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ or ≥).

## Is a closed or open dot on a number line?
A solid dot on a number line graph indicates that the given number should be included as a possible solution, whereas an open dot indicates that the given number cannot be a solution. For example, if you graph x > 7, you place an open dot at 7 because it's not a valid answer (7 is not greater than itself).

## What is a hollow dot in math?
Functions and Graphs On a graph, a solid dot is used for a closed endpoint and a hollow dot is used for an open endpoint.Feb 12, 2012
