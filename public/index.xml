      <description>How do you find your twin flame number? To get your joined life path number, add both life path numbers (your twins and yours) and deduce them to a single digit. The added sum is your joined life path number. For instance, if you are a life path 4, and your twin flame is a life path 3, your joined life path number would be a 7 (4+3=7).Sep 15, 2021</description>
