  "articleBody": " What does the last digit on a tire mean? The very last number in the sequence, “15,” is the diameter of the tire. This is an important number—this is the number you’ll refer to when you need to know your tire size! The “15” indicates that this particular tire would fit a rim with a 15-inch diameter.\nCan I use 235 tires instead of 245? The quick answer is yes you can replace 245/50-18 tyres with 235/50-18 but they will have 10mm (0.4 in) smaller overall diameter. Will only slightly effect speedo and odometer - ie speedo will read about 1.5% high.\nIs the last number on a tire the rim size? The final figure in a tire size sequence is the speed rating, which is indicated by a letter: P225/70R16 91S. Just as your load index number corresponds to a specific load, your speed rating letter corresponds to a particular speed capability based on a standardized laboratory test.\nWhat numbers have to match on tires? Width and diameter are the two factors that determine tire and rim compatibility. For diameter you’ll need to be sure that your tires and wheels are an exact match, e.g. a 215/65R17 tire will only fit on a 17\" diameter wheel.\nWhat does the last letter on a tire mean? SPEED RATING\nCan you put a different tire size on the same rim? Wheels and tires are not interchangeable words. Tires are a part of the wheel setup. For instance, your vehicle has a set size of rims, but you can buy different sizes of tires to fit those rims, as long as the middle of the tires is the correct size.Apr 13, 2020\nCan I put bigger tires on without changing the rim? As a general rule of thumb, it’s safe to fit a tire up to 20 millimeters wider than stock on the original rim. The actual width of the tire will vary depending on the width of the rim: The tire will expand 5 millimeters for every half inch (12.5 millimeters) increase in rim width.\nCan you put 235 tires on 215 rims? 215 and 235 tires are interchangeable if they come with the same tire aspect ratio and the same rim diameter. If the rim diameters don’t match you will have to invest in new wheels in order to mount larger tires onto your car.\nCan I use a 175 tire instead of 185? That is the size you would ideally want to stay with. Both a 175/80-13 and 185/80-13 will fit the same size wheels (4-1/2 to 5-1/2 inch wide) and they are about the same diameter (between 24 and 24-1/2 inches). The major difference is the capacity. A 175 tops out at 1,610 pounds for a load range D, # AM10210.May 15, 2014\nWhat is the difference between tire size 245 and 235? A 245 tire is wider than a 235 tire. When you get to a 35 series profile is when the tires start to be low profile.Dec 28, 2010\nCan a different tire size be used? Wheels and tires are not interchangeable words. Tires are a part of the wheel setup. For instance, your vehicle has a set size of rims, but you can buy different sizes of tires to fit those rims, as long as the middle of the tires is the correct size.Apr 13, 2020\nCan you change tire size without changing rims? It’s possible to change the size of your tires without actually changing the diameter. One example is if you want larger rims - you can buy tires that compensate for the larger rims by reducing the “height” of the outer tire.\nIs there a big difference between 225 and 235 tires? If you care about gas mileage and such, get a light tire and a tire with less rolling resistance, meaning not the 255/40, because tires with thicker rubber and wider tread usually have higher rolling resistance. The differences of weight between 225 and 235 are probably negligible.Mar 28, 2007\nCan I use 245 instead of 235 tires? The quick answer is yes you can replace 245/50-18 tyres with 235/50-18 but they will have 10mm (0.4 in) smaller overall diameter. Will only slightly effect speedo and odometer - ie speedo will read about 1.5% high.\nWhat size tire is bigger 235 or 245? A 245 tire is wider than a 235 tire. When you get to a 35 series profile is when the tires start to be low profile.Dec 28, 2010\nIs 245 A wide tire? A 245 is 245 millimeters, or 24.5 centimeters, wide. The tread width is actually somewhat smaller than the tire’s actual width.\nWill 245 65R17 fit 235 65R17? Expert Reply: Yes, a size 235/65R17 tire will fit the same wheel as a 245/65R17 size tire.Feb 15, 2018\nDoes the last number on a tire matter? Treadwear Grade Treadwear is the easiest to decipher as it is a three-digit number that indicates how long tread on the tire will last relative to other tires. In theory and in similar conditions, a tire with a 300 treadwear rating will last three times as long as one with a 100 rating, and so on.\nWhat does the last number on a tire mean? The very last number in the sequence, “15,” is the diameter of the tire. This is an important number—this is the number you’ll refer to when you need to know your tire size! The “15” indicates that this particular tire would fit a rim with a 15-inch diameter.\nWhat does the last number and letter on a tire mean? The number is the load rating, or the amount of weight that it can handle. The letter is the speed rating, or the maximum speed the tire is built for. As an example, a tire rated 90R could safely carry 1,323 pounds and travel at 106 mph. Consult a load and speed index to find out what your tire’s specific rating means.Oct 30, 2018\nWhat do all the numbers on tires mean? In this example, the 45 indicates that the sidewall distance, from the wheel rim to the outside of the tread, is 45% of the section width. A lower aspect ratio means a lower-profile tire with a shorter sidewall, while a tire with a higher aspect ratio will have a taller sidewall and look more like a donut.\nWhat does the last letter on a tire mean? SPEED RATING\nDoes the last number on a tire matter? Treadwear Grade Treadwear is the easiest to decipher as it is a three-digit number that indicates how long tread on the tire will last relative to other tires.

B: TIRE WIDTH The three-digit number following the letter is the tire’s width (from side to side, looking at the tire head on) in millimeters. This may also be referred to as the section width. C: ASPECT RATIO The forward slash separates the tire width number from the two-digit aspect ratio.\nCan I use 235 tires instead of 245? The quick answer is yes you can replace 245/50-18 tyres with 235/50-18 but they will have 10mm (0.4 in) smaller overall diameter. Will only slightly effect speedo and odometer - ie speedo will read about 1.5% high.\nWhat does the 265 70R17 mean? An arrow points to the numbers 265/70R17 115T on the inner part of the tire sidewall. 265 is the width, 70 is the aspect ratio, R stands for radial, 17 is the wheel diameter and 115T is the load index and speed symbol. ©2022 Nitto Tire U.S.A. Inc.\nCan I use 205 60r16 instead of 205 55r16? Yes. It will have a slightly lower sidewall height, but should work fine.Nov 16, 2018\nWhich number on tire is rim size? RIM DIAMETER The next number is the wheel’s diameter. For example, a tire with the P225/70R16 91S would fit a rim with a 16-inch diameter.Apr 1, 2021\nWhat does the last number on a tire mean? Wheel size. The final number group, the “18,” is the size of wheel the tire fits. In our example size, the tire will fit a 18-inch wheel.\nDoes the tire tell you the size of the rim? Wheel Size (Rim Diameter) Located after Construction is the wheel size, which tells us the size of the wheel/rim that the tire is intended to fit and is measured from one end of the wheel to the other. If the tire size is 255/60 R16, the 16 means that the wheel is 16\" in diameter.\nIs it OK to drive with different size tires? Having different sizes on some four wheel and all wheel drive vehicles can actually do damage to the vehicle. Since tires vary from brand to brand, and even from model to model, damage can even occur with tires of the same size if they have a large enough difference in circumference.\nHow much difference in tire size is acceptable? 3%\nWhat happens if you run different size tires? If you continually use mismatched tires and wheels they will wear out unevenly and can cause problems later down the road. If you choose to drive your vehicle with mismatched wheels the same issues can result. Mismatched wheels will fit each tire differently causing uneven wear and tear.Dec 20, 2016\nCan the wrong size tire damage your car? Unfortunately, altering the tire size of a vehicle without thorough and careful consideration is a decision that can really bite. Fitting the wrong tire size can cause damage to a vehicle, and is a real safety hazard as well.\nWhat does the last number and letter mean on a tire? The number is the load rating, or the amount of weight that it can handle. The letter is the speed rating, or the maximum speed the tire is built for.

<p>215 and 235 tires are interchangeable if they come with the same tire aspect ratio and the same rim diameter. If the rim diameters don&rsquo;t match you will have to invest in new wheels in order to mount larger tires onto your car.</p>

<p>That is the size you would ideally want to stay with. Both a 175/80-13 and 185/80-13 will fit the same size wheels (4-1/2 to 5-1/2 inch wide) and they are about the same diameter (between 24 and 24-1/2 inches). The major difference is the capacity. A 175 tops out at 1,610 pounds for a load range D, # AM10210.May 15, 2014</p>

<p>Wheels and tires are not interchangeable words. Tires are a part of the wheel setup. For instance, your vehicle has a set size of rims, but you can buy different sizes of tires to fit those rims, as long as the middle of the tires is the correct size.Apr 13, 2020</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to change the size of your tires without actually changing the diameter. One example is if you want larger rims - you can buy tires that compensate for the larger rims by reducing the &ldquo;height&rdquo; of the outer tire.</p>

<p>If you care about gas mileage and such, get a light tire and a tire with less rolling resistance, meaning not the 255/40, because tires with thicker rubber and wider tread usually have higher rolling resistance. The differences of weight between 225 and 235 are probably negligible.Mar 28, 2007</p>

<p>The quick answer is yes you can replace 245/50-18 tyres with 235/50-18 but they will have 10mm (0.4 in) smaller overall diameter. Will only slightly effect speedo and odometer - ie speedo will read about 1.5% high.</p>

<p>Treadwear Grade Treadwear is the easiest to decipher as it is a three-digit number that indicates how long tread on the tire will last relative to other tires. In theory and in similar conditions, a tire with a 300 treadwear rating will last three times as long as one with a 100 rating, and so on.</p>

<p>The very last number in the sequence, “15,” is the diameter of the tire. This is an important number—this is the number you&rsquo;ll refer to when you need to know your tire size! The “15” indicates that this particular tire would fit a rim with a 15-inch diameter.</p>

<p>The number is the load rating, or the amount of weight that it can handle. The letter is the speed rating, or the maximum speed the tire is built for. As an example, a tire rated 90R could safely carry 1,323 pounds and travel at 106 mph. Consult a load and speed index to find out what your tire&rsquo;s specific rating means.Oct 30, 2018</p>

<p>In this example, the 45 indicates that the sidewall distance, from the wheel rim to the outside of the tread, is 45% of the section width. A lower aspect ratio means a lower-profile tire with a shorter sidewall, while a tire with a higher aspect ratio will have a taller sidewall and look more like a donut.</p>
