<p>At the end of the day, this tracking update simply means that a label has been created but it isn&rsquo;t yet included on any shipping manifest or uploaded into any backend infrastructure (which usually means the package hasn&rsquo;t been received by the shipping company just yet, either).May 21, 2021</p>

<p>The next steps would be to apply the label to the package, and for FedEx to pick up the parcel (or for the seller to deliver the parcel to a FedEx office). Depending on the shipping instructions, FedEx usually picks up shipments within one or two business days.Jun 11, 2020</p>

<p>If you notice the tracking status reads &ldquo;Label Created&rdquo;, that means the shipment has been paid for and it&rsquo;s awaiting the first &ldquo;in-transit&rdquo; scan by the carrier. Occasionally, shipping statuses can remain in the &ldquo;Label Created&rdquo; stage for 1-2 business days after the seller has dropped the package off with the carrier.</p>

<p>FedEx. FedEx labels are charged once they enter the mail stream. Once the FedEx representative scans the package, the cost will be billed to your account. Note: If you&rsquo;re creating test labels in Ordoro, we recommend using your FedEx account so you won&rsquo;t incur any charges.Jan 26, 2022</p>

<p>This means that your order was processed and packaged at our warehouse but has not been scanned at a shipping location. Unfortunately this tracking status is hard to diagnose. It could mean that your package was picked up and never scanned, and eventually it will be and the tracking will become updated at some point.Oct 2, 2020</p>
