A line is made of a set of points which is extended in opposite directions infinitely. It is determined by two points in a two-dimensional plane. The two points which lie on the same line are said to be collinear points.\nWhat does || U || mean? ||u|| and the distance between u and v by. Distance = ||u - v|| The angle q between two vectors is defined by. u .\nWhat does it mean when a number has 2 lines around it? The symbol for absolute value is two vertical lines. Since opposites are the same distance from the origin, they have the same absolute value. For example, the absolute value of “negative 10” is ten, and the absolute value of “positive 10” is also 10. The absolute value of zero is zero.\nWhat does double || mean in math? Double bars (or sometimes even single bars) tend to denote a norm in Mathematics. Most likely, the double bars here are denoting the Euclidean norm. This is just the length of the vector. So for example, the vector (I shall write it horizontally for compactness) (1,2,3) has length ‖(1,2,3)‖=√12+22+32=√14.Nov 30, 2013\nWhat do || mean in math?
