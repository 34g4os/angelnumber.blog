<p>“The number of” takes a singular verb In English, “the number of” doesn&rsquo;t mean “many.” Tell your students to think of it as one number. So even though that number might be large, the purpose of this expression is to compare this one number/amount with another number/amount.Oct 4, 2012</p>

<p>Although the expression &lsquo;a number&rsquo; is strictly singular, the phrase &lsquo;a number of&rsquo;&rsquo; is used with plural nouns (as what grammarians call a determiner (or determiner)). The verb should therefore be plural: A number of people are waiting for the bus.Aug 23, 2018</p>

<p>Although “a number of (anything)&quot; looks as if it requires a singular verb (since it&rsquo;s &ldquo;a number”), it actually requires a plural verb—every single time. “A large number of” is always followed by a plural noun; it would be wrong to say or write “a large number of cat” or “a large number of dog,” etc.Jul 11, 2013</p>
