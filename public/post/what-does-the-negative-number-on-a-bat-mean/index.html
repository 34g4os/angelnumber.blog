<p>Fundamentally, there are no differences between Drop 8 and Drop 10 bats other than the scale weight. Although each USSSA brand and model has its own vibe, the industry generally holds to these rules when moving from a drop 8 to a drop 10.Dec 10, 2020</p>

<p>Bat drop is printed weight, in ounces, minus printed length, in inches. For example, a bat labeled 13.5 ounces and 26 inches has a bat drop of minus 12.5 (13.5-26 = -12.5). To get the right bat, you just need to match the right drop, weight, and length printed on the bat to the age, height, and weight of the player.Oct 14, 2016</p>
