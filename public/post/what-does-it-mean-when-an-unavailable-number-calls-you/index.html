<p>If you answer the call, your number is considered &lsquo;good&rsquo; by the scammers, even if you don&rsquo;t necessarily fall for the scam. They will try again because they know someone on the other side is a potential victim of fraud. The less you answer, the fewer robocalls you will receive.</p>

<p>Can I trace unknown, blocked, or private numbers? Private numbers, blocked, and restricted calls can usually be traced. However, unknown, unavailable or out of area calls are not traceable because they don&rsquo;t contain the data needed for a successful trace.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-calling-me-from-an-unavailable-number">Who is calling me from an unavailable number?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#who-is-calling-me-from-an-unavailable-number">#</a></h2>
<p>This feature typically generates a &ldquo;Restricted&rdquo; identification on the receiver&rsquo;s end, but it can also be identified as &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unknown Caller.&rdquo; Phone calls that show up as &ldquo;Unavailable&rdquo; are the result of your phone carrier&rsquo;s inability to identify a caller&rsquo;s number.</p>

<p>With TrapCall, you can unmask these blocked numbers and find out exactly who&rsquo;s calling you from No Caller ID. That means their phone number, name, and even their address. Plus, with TrapCall you can even blacklist the unmasked phone number to prevent them from continuing to harass you.Sep 21, 2017</p>
