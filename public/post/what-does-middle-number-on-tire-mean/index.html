The 245/75R16 is 6.5\" to 8\" and the 265/70R16 7\" to 8.5\".Dec 16, 2013\nWhat does 245 mean on a tire? 245: The width of the tire, from sidewall to sidewall, in millimeters. A 245 is 245 millimeters, or 24.5 centimeters, wide. The tread width is actually somewhat smaller than the tire’s actual width. 45: Aspect Ratio. This is the sidewall’s height from the inside diameter to the outside diameter.\nHow much bigger is a 215 tire than a 205? The diameter of the 205 is 26.3 inches and for the 215 the diameter is 26.7 inches. That is 0.4 inches of difference meaning that it would raise the height of the trailer by 0.2 inches.Apr 11, 2016\nShould all Tyres be the same size? For optimal safety and performance, we recommend fitting the same tyres to every wheel position on your car, so you should have the same brand, size, tread pattern, load index and speed rating on the front and rear tyres.\nWill 205 55R16 fit 215 55R16? The width of the tire 205/55R16 is 10 mm narrower than the 215/55R16, they are OK, it wouldn’t cause any problem. Aside from the obvious difference in wheel size, a 205/55R16 “should” fit a car with an original size of 215/50R17.Jan 24, 2021\nCan you use a 215 tire instead of 205? Physically they should fit on the rim and tire without issue. The difference is going to be the rolling distance is a bit shorter for the new (to you) tires. 215 to 205 is 1cm difference in width.Jan 15, 2021\nCan you put a different tire size on the same rim?

<p>245: The width of the tire, from sidewall to sidewall, in millimeters. A 245 is 245 millimeters, or 24.5 centimeters, wide. The tread width is actually somewhat smaller than the tire&rsquo;s actual width. 45: Aspect Ratio. This is the sidewall&rsquo;s height from the inside diameter to the outside diameter.</p>

<p>That is the size you would ideally want to stay with. Both a 175/80-13 and 185/80-13 will fit the same size wheels (4-1/2 to 5-1/2 inch wide) and they are about the same diameter (between 24 and 24-1/2 inches). The major difference is the capacity.

<p>If you care about gas mileage and such, get a light tire and a tire with less rolling resistance, meaning not the 255/40, because tires with thicker rubber and wider tread usually have higher rolling resistance.

<p>Really alot of variation with all the combinations out there. Both 205 and 215 will work OK esp for 16&quot; to 18&quot; wheels. You&rsquo;ll get a lighter tire and slightly less rolling resistance with the 205- overall a good street tire that can wear well but that depends on the softness of the rubber compound.Jul 28, 2005</p>

<p>Short answer, it will be fine. Long answer, it will be fine as long as the load rating is equal or higher capacity. Not many high load rated tires in those sizes, so probably ok. Tire sizes are metric, and are read as follows: 205(tread width in mm)/65(side wall ratio, so 65% of tread width)R15(rim 15 inch diameter).Jan 24, 2021</p>

<p>The Quick Answer Using 215 mm tires instead of 205 mm tires will result in better traction in dry conditions which helps to improve acceleration. However, 205 mm tires are less prone to aquaplaning and result in better fuel economy and less road noise compared to 215 mm tires. Narrower tires are also less expensive.</p>

Tire sizes are metric, and are read as follows: 205(tread width in mm)/65(side wall ratio, so 65% of tread width)R15(rim 15 inch diameter).Jan 24, 2021</p>

<p>The two-digit number after the slash mark in a tire size is the aspect ratio. For example, in a size P215/65 R15 tire, the 65 means that the height is equal to 65% of the tire&rsquo;s width. The bigger the aspect ratio, the bigger the tire&rsquo;s sidewall will be.</p>

<p>The quick answer is yes you can replace 245/50-18 tyres with 235/50-18 but they will have 10mm (0.4 in) smaller overall diameter. Will only slightly effect speedo and odometer - ie speedo will read about 1.5% high.</p>

<p>Tire Diameter No matter what type of vehicle you&rsquo;re picking tires for, one of the most important specifications to consider is the tire&rsquo;s overall diameter.Jun 23, 2020</p>
<h2 id="does-tire-size-really-matter">Does tire size really matter?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#does-tire-size-really-matter">#</a></h2>
<p>As a tire&rsquo;s width increases, it covers more surface area on the road. According to iSee Cars, this increase in contact with the pavement gives your vehicle more to hold onto, increasing its handling and ability to maneuver. So, does tire size really matter? The short answer is: Yes.Apr 13, 2020</p>

<p>Tire Diameter or Size: 215/65 R15 The very last number in the sequence, “15,” is the diameter of the tire. This is an important number—this is the number you&rsquo;ll refer to when you need to know your tire size! The “15” indicates that this particular tire would fit a rim with a 15-inch diameter.</p>

<p>The tire width will affect their price and several other characteristics, such as grip, noise level, driving comfort, and appearance. Replacing narrow tires with wider ones will usually increase rolling resistance and, therefore, slightly increase fuel consumption.Apr 25, 2019</p>

<p>Physically they should fit on the rim and tire without issue. The difference is going to be the rolling distance is a bit shorter for the new (to you) tires. 215 to 205 is 1cm difference in width.Jan 14, 2021</p>

<p>The width of the tire 205/55R16 is 10 mm narrower than the 215/55R16, they are OK, it wouldn&rsquo;t cause any problem. Aside from the obvious difference in wheel size, a 205/55R16 “should” fit a car with an original size of 215/50R17.Jan 24, 2021</p>

<p>The diameter of the 205 is 26.3 inches and for the 215 the diameter is 26.7 inches. That is 0.4 inches of difference meaning that it would raise the height of the trailer by 0.2 inches.May 1, 2021</p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, it&rsquo;s safe to fit a tire up to 20 millimeters wider than stock on the original rim. The actual width of the tire will vary depending on the width of the rim: The tire will expand 5 millimeters for every half inch (12.5 millimeters) increase in rim width.</p>

<p>The first number, 215, is the width of the tire between the widest points of its inner and outer sidewalls. This is expressed in millimeters. So your tire is 215 millimeters wide, or 8.471 inches wide.Mar 2, 2014</p>
