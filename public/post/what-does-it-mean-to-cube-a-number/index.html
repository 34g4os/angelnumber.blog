A cube number is the result when a number has been multiplied by itself twice. The symbol for cubed is 3. For example, 8 is a cube number because it’s 2 x 2 x 2 (2 multiplied by itself twice); this is also written as 23 (“two cubed”). Another example of a cube number is 27 because it’s 33 (3 x 3 x 3, or “three cubed”).\nWhat is the cube of 3 square? What is the Cube Root of 3? The cube root of 3 is the number which when multiplied by itself three times gives the product as 3. The number 3 is prime. Therefore, the cube root of 3 = ∛3 = 1.4422.\nWhat is the cube of (- 5? Answer: (-5)³ = -125 is the correct answer.Jul 19, 2020\nWhat is the cube of (- 1? The cube of (-1) is​ -1. We know, A Cube of a number is the product of the square of the number with the number itself. For example: . To find the cube of -1, we need to multiply -1 bu itself three times or multiply with -1.Sep 2, 2020\nWhat is the cube of -(- 4? The value of cube root of 4 is approximately equal to 1.5874.\nWhat is the cube of 3 answer? 27\nWhat is the cube of √ 3? What is the Cube Root of 3? The cube root of 3 is the number which when multiplied by itself three times gives the product as 3. The number 3 is prime. Therefore, the cube root of 3 = ∛3 = 1.4422.\nWhat is the cube of 4? 64\nWhat is the cube of (- 3 )? Hence, the cube of (-3) is -27.Sep 3, 2021\nWhat is the cube of 5 answer? 125\nWhat’s the cube of 3? An easy way to write 3 cubed is 33. This means three multiplied by itself three times. The easiest way to do this calculation is to do the first multiplication (3x3) and then to multiply your answer by the same number you started with; 3 x 3 x 3 = 9 x 3 = 27.\nWhat is the cube of 3 answer?
