This makes it perform much better during the winter season than 10w30. 10w30, on the other hand, will flow effectively in hot summers or higher temperatures.Apr 16, 2022\nIs 10w30 OK for winter? 10W30 vs 10W40 Oil FAQs 10W-30 motor oil is recommended for ambient temperatures not exceeding -30°C/-22°F in the winter or 35°C/95°F in the summer. This is a great motor oil to use if you live in Canada or cooler U.S. states. Colder regions would require 5W-20, while hotter regions may call for 10W-40.\nWhat oil is best for winter driving? The Bottom Line A multi-viscosity 5W30 oil flows quicker in cold weather and is recommended for year-round protection, and a synthetic 5W30 multi-viscosity will provide the best protection you can get in both extremely cold weather and extremely hot engine temperatures.\nWill it hurt to run 5w30 instead of 10w30? Can you use 5W-30 instead of 10W-30? Absolutely yes for car engines, 5W-30 is usually synthetic and superior to 10W-30. Both have the same viscosity at the operating temperature of an average car engine. 5W has lower viscosity when cool and is considered better for the car engine during engine start.\nWhat happens if you use 5w30 instead of 10w30? So both the oils 5W–30 and 10W–30 have exactly the same viscosity (SAE 30) when your engine is running, and will perform in the same way. However, the 10W–30 oil will be thicker (higher viscosity) than the 5W–30 when it is cool.\nIs it better to use 5w30 or 10w30? Lubrication. 5w30 provides better lubrication compared to 10w30. It is best suited for private vehicles and light-duty diesel and petrol engines, while 10w30 is more suitable for commercial vehicles and other cars with heavy load engines.Apr 16, 2022\nShould I use thicker oil in an older engine? A: Yes. This is a practical method to improve oil pressure in an older, high-mileage engine. The slightly thicker oil film from the heavier base weight oil - 10W - can help protect worn engine bearings as well.Jun 1, 2013\nIs 5w30 or 10w30 better for summer? Answer: There is absolutely no need to switch to 10W-30 motor oil in the summer if 5W-30 is an acceptable grade for your engine. While some car manufacturers still advocate the use of 10W-30 (or even 10W-40) as an appropriate engine oil option for summer use, it is completely unnecessary.Apr 25, 2015\nWhat happens if you use 5w30 instead of 10w30?

While some car manufacturers still advocate the use of 10W-30 (or even 10W-40) as an appropriate engine oil option for summer use, it is completely unnecessary.Apr 25, 2015\nWill thicker oil damage my engine? Using oil that is thicker than recommended may lead to a decrease in fuel economy, a higher load on your engine, and even a shorter life for your engine. Conversely, using thinner, lighter-weight oil than recommended can cause excessive wear and shorter life.Nov 14, 2019\nWhich engine oil is best for old engines? In most temperate climates, a 10W oil will suffice, but the best motor oil for high mileage engines in cold weather will start with 5W or even 0W.Nov 20, 2018\nDo older cars need heavier oil? Older cars can use modern oils too, just base the first viscosity on your climate, e.g., 0W for northern Canada, 10W for Florida, and use the original oil spec for the operating weight. Most older cars work fine with 10W30. While we’re on the topic of oil, it’s worth taking a moment to demystify synthetic oil.Jul 3, 2012\nIs 5W30 better for older cars? 5W-20 and 5W30 motor oil are winter viscosity grade oils primarily recommended for older engines and light-duty use. These oils are best utilized in colder temperatures.Oct 29, 2021\nIs it OK to use 5w30 instead of 5w20? 5W20 Temperature Range Chart As you can see, there’s quite the difference in how these two types of oil perform. With these numbers in mind, it’s clear that using 5W30 motor oil instead of 5W20 could lead to serious damage to your engine.Jan 31, 2021\nWhich oil is heavier 5w20 or 5w30? The higher the number the higher the viscosity hence 5w30 is thicker than the 5w20. What is this? Both engine oils, 5w20 and 5w30, have the same design of viscosity during winter but differs with the weight during warmer temperatures.\nWhich oil is better 5w30 or 10w30? Suitable Vehicle Types. 5W-30 multi grade oil is ideal for private vehicles and light-duty petrol and diesel engines. It also provides a better cold temperature start than 10W-30 oil. On the other hand, the slightly thicker oil,10W-30, provides better lubrication for commercial vehicles and heavy-load engine cars.Nov 29, 2021\nWhat happens if you use 5w30 instead of 10w30? So both the oils 5W–30 and 10W–30 have exactly the same viscosity (SAE 30) when your engine is running, and will perform in the same way. However, the 10W–30 oil will be thicker (higher viscosity) than the 5W–30 when it is cool.\nIs there a big difference between 5w30 and 10w30? Both the oils have similar viscosity at 100 degrees Celsius but 5w30 grade oil will thicken less than 10w30 grade oil in cold climate. This means 5w30 grade oil will flow effectively in low temperatures, whereas 10w30 oil will flow effectively in high temperatures because of the smaller temperature window.\nIs 5w30 or 10w30 better for winter? 10w30, the thinner 5w30 will circulate quicker, and flow through bearing tolerances better during an engine startup in the winter or colder climates. The “w” behind the five and the 10 indicates that those are the viscosities in colder or winter temperatures.\nWhat do the second numbers on oil mean? viscosity\nCan I put 5w30 instead of 5w20? In general, it is not recommended that you use 5w30 oil (or any other oil weight) in place of 5w20 oil, as the slightest difference in viscosity can potentially damage your engine.Apr 28, 2022\nWhat’s the difference between 5w30 and 5w20? 5w20 is an engine oil type characterized by its winter rating of 5 and an oil weight of 20 in warmer conditions. It is less viscous compared to 5w30. 5w30 has the same viscosity rating of 5 during winter but an oil weight of 30 during hotter conditions hence it is thicker.\nCan I use 10w40 instead of 5w30? Your vehicle does not use 5W-30 oil. The recommended oil viscosity for your vehicle, according to Kia documentation, is 10W-40. If you drive the vehicle in exceptionally cold weather, well below 32 degrees, you can use 5W-30 oil but even 10W-40 is still perfectly OK to use if outdoor temperatures are below freezing.Oct 21, 2017\nCan I put 10w30 instead of 5w30? Can I Mix 10w30 and 5w30? Most oils will mix perfectly, provided they have a similar synthetic. Therefore, there is no problem in mixing 10w30 and 5w30 since one will be topping up. Mixing the viscosity of oils will not have any effect on the engine.Apr 16, 2022\nIs 5W 30 oil better than 10w30? 5W-30 multi grade oil is ideal for private vehicles and light-duty petrol and diesel engines. It also provides a better cold temperature start than 10W-30 oil. On the other hand, the slightly thicker oil,10W-30, provides better lubrication for commercial vehicles and heavy-load engine cars.Nov 29, 2021\nIs 5w30 or 10w30 better for winter? 10w30, the thinner 5w30 will circulate quicker, and flow through bearing tolerances better during an engine startup in the winter or colder climates. The “w” behind the five and the 10 indicates that those are the viscosities in colder or winter temperatures.\nShould I use thicker oil in an older engine? A: Yes. This is a practical method to improve oil pressure in an older, high-mileage engine. The slightly thicker oil film from the heavier base weight oil - 10W - can help protect worn engine bearings as well.Jun 1, 2013\nWill it hurt my car if I use 10w30 instead of 5w20? Notwithstanding the recommendations of the car manufacturer, mixing 10w30 and 5w20 will not cause any sort of harm to the engine. However, a few drivers claim that it is safer to combine two multi-grade or straight weight oils, rather than mixing multi-grade with straight weight oils.Dec 1, 2021\nIs there a big difference between 5w30 and 10w30? Both the oils have similar viscosity at 100 degrees Celsius but 5w30 grade oil will thicken less than 10w30 grade oil in cold climate. This means 5w30 grade oil will flow effectively in low temperatures, whereas 10w30 oil will flow effectively in high temperatures because of the smaller temperature window.\nCan I use 10w30 instead of 5w30 Reddit? This is not true. The viscosity does not change the physical size of oil. Viscosity is resistance to flow, nothing more.Jan 22, 2020\nWhat happens if I use 5W-20 instead of 5W-30? Mixing 5W-20 and 5W-30 (or any other oils for that matter) may lead to faster wear and tear of your engine and eventually cause problems with the basic functioning of critical engine parts. And even if your engine allows it, you won’t get any noticeable results by mixing different viscosity grade oils.Oct 29, 2021\nWhich is thicker 5W30 or 5 20? So, due to viscosity, 5w20 is a thinner oil during operating temperatures, whereas 5w30 is thicker during operating temperatures.\nWhat’s the difference between 520 and 530 oil? This means that both grades exhibit the same viscosity under cold conditions. However, 5W-30 features a slightly higher viscosity at 100 degrees Celsius than does 5W-20. This means that once the engine reaches normal operating temperature, 5W-30 oil will be thicker than 5W-20.\nWhat oil is heavier than 5W20? The motor oil is categorized according to its viscosity. Whether the oil is thicker or extra thinner, it specifies the type of engine it is suitable for. There are hundreds of oils but 10w30 and 5w20 are the most common of all. The 10w30 type is the thicker one and 5w20 is the thinner.Jun 5, 2018\nIs 5w30 oil thicker than 10w30? Both the oils have similar viscosity at 100 degrees Celsius but 5w30 grade oil will thicken less than 10w30 grade oil in cold climate. This means 5w30 grade oil will flow effectively in low temperatures, whereas 10w30 oil will flow effectively in high temperatures because of the smaller temperature window.\nCan I use 5w20 instead of 5w30 oil? Mixing 5W-20 and 5W-30 (or any other oils for that matter) may lead to faster wear and tear of your engine and eventually cause problems with the basic functioning of critical engine parts. And even if your engine allows it, you won’t get any noticeable results by mixing different viscosity grade oils.Oct 29, 2021\n",

<p>10W30 vs 10W40 Oil FAQs 10W-30 motor oil is recommended for ambient temperatures not exceeding -30°C/-22°F in the winter or 35°C/95°F in the summer. This is a great motor oil to use if you live in Canada or cooler U.S. states. Colder regions would require 5W-20, while hotter regions may call for 10W-40.</p>

<p>Can you use 5W-30 instead of 10W-30? Absolutely yes for car engines, 5W-30 is usually synthetic and superior to 10W-30. Both have the same viscosity at the operating temperature of an average car engine. 5W has lower viscosity when cool and is considered better for the car engine during engine start.</p>
