<p>The quick answer is yes you can replace 245/50-18 tyres with 235/50-18 but they will have 10mm (0.4 in) smaller overall diameter. Will only slightly effect speedo and odometer - ie speedo will read about 1.5% high.</p>

<p>Aspect Ratio: 215/65 R15 “65” in the sequence is the aspect ratio of the tire. The aspect ratio is a percentage, and it tells you the ratio of the tire&rsquo;s height to its width. In this example, the aspect ratio number “65” means that the tire&rsquo;s height is 65 percent of its width.</p>

<p>The numbers in the tire size refer to its width, aspect ratio, and wheel diameter. &ldquo;275/35R19&rdquo; means the tire is 275 mm wide, has an aspect ratio (that is, the width divided by the height) of 35%, and fits on a 19&quot; wheel.</p>

<p>Getting wider tires is a great way to give your car a unique look, especially if you&rsquo;re taking it to a car show, but will stock rims be able to fit wider tires? Yes, you can get wider tires on stock rims.Apr 14, 2022</p>

<p>Tires are a part of the wheel setup. For instance, your vehicle has a set size of rims, but you can buy different sizes of tires to fit those rims, as long as the middle of the tires is the correct size. That being said, a vehicle with bigger rims will often be able to fit larger tires than other vehicles.Apr 13, 2020</p>

<p>If a tire that&rsquo;s too wide for a rim is mounted, the tire shape becomes too tall and round, like a lollipop or lightbulb, and then it becomes floppy at the top because the casing is constricted. This can result in poor cornering performance and tire squirm.Dec 19, 2018</p>

<p>First, bigger tires are usually much heavier. Adding a set of four big and heavy tires to your vehicle will add a lot of new weight. That added weight can hurt your car&rsquo;s acceleration and expend more fuel. It can also put more strain on your brakes to slow down the vehicle.Dec 14, 2020</p>

<p>265 = Section Width in millimeters (measured at the widest part of the tire from sidewall to sidewall) /60 = Aspect Ratio or section height to width ratio as a percentage. For this example, the side wall is 60% of the section width of the tire (265mm x . 60 = 159mm). Therefore, the sidewall height is 159mm.</p>

<p>245: The width of the tire, from sidewall to sidewall, in millimeters. A 245 is 245 millimeters, or 24.5 centimeters, wide. The tread width is actually somewhat smaller than the tire&rsquo;s actual width. 45: Aspect Ratio. This is the sidewall&rsquo;s height from the inside diameter to the outside diameter.</p>

<p>Wheels and tires are not interchangeable words. Tires are a part of the wheel setup. For instance, your vehicle has a set size of rims, but you can buy different sizes of tires to fit those rims, as long as the middle of the tires is the correct size.Apr 13, 2020</p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, it&rsquo;s safe to fit a tire up to 20 millimeters wider than stock on the original rim. The actual width of the tire will vary depending on the width of the rim: The tire will expand 5 millimeters for every half inch (12.5 millimeters) increase in rim width.</p>

<p>215 and 235 tires are interchangeable if they come with the same tire aspect ratio and the same rim diameter. If the rim diameters don&rsquo;t match you will have to invest in new wheels in order to mount larger tires onto your car.</p>

<p>That is the size you would ideally want to stay with. Both a 175/80-13 and 185/80-13 will fit the same size wheels (4-1/2 to 5-1/2 inch wide) and they are about the same diameter (between 24 and 24-1/2 inches). The major difference is the capacity. A 175 tops out at 1,610 pounds for a load range D, # AM10210.May 15, 2014</p>
