An SPF 15 sunscreen blocks 93% of UVB radiation, and SPF 30 blocks 97%. After that, the difference in protection is small. SPF 50 blocks 98%, and SPF 100 stops 99% of UVB rays from reaching your skin.May 28, 2021\nWhat does Kensei 69 tattoo mean? Kensei is a tall, muscular man with sharp features, short light-gray/silver hair and brown eyes. He has a tattoo of the number “69” on his chest; the “6” represents his last name, “Muguruma,” which uses the kanji for “6” in it, while the “9” represents the 9th Division, which he currently leads.\nWhat does Shuhei 69 tattoo mean? I quote the Bleach wiki, the source of all random Bleach facts: “He has a tattoo of the number “69” on his chest; the “6” represents his last name, “Muguruma,” which uses the kanji for “6” in it, while the “9” represents the 9th Division, which he currently leads. “Oct 1, 2012\nWhy does hisoka have a 69 tattoo? Additionally, he has the number “69” tattooed on his left cheek (inspired by Kensei Muguruma, who saved him from a Hollow when he was young), as well as a blue-striped tattoo running across his left cheek and over the bridge of his nose.\nWhat does the number 69 mean in Japan? It seems that the meaning of his tattoo of “69” was revealed in the episode aired on May 12th. Spoilers ahead; The internet tells me that it turns out that it was a pun meaning “muku” which means “innocent (and pure)” in Japanese.Jul 15, 2008\n",
