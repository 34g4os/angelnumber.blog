<p>“When [you] see 1111 repeatedly, it means that [you] have not understood, accepted or believed in the message,” explains Genna. “It is believed that the angels will keep trying to get the message through because they are persistent.” Stop being stubborn or obstinate.May 1, 2022</p>

<p>Can 1111 be a warning? 11:11 is an angel number so it is never going to warn you about danger. It is never a bad sign. The number often is shown to remind you to “align yourself during the impending changes, even though it may seem bad at times, everything that&rsquo;s happening is to your benefit.”Nov 11, 2021</p>
