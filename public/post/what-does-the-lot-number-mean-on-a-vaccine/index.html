Yes. All currently authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and CDC does not recommend one vaccine over another. The most important decision is to get a COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible.\nIs it safe to take the Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or J\u0026J COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy? No safety concerns were found in animal studies: Studies in animals receiving a Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or Johnson \u0026 Johnson (J\u0026J)/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns in pregnant animals or their babies.\nCan the COVID-19 vaccine affect your period? A US study of 4,000 people found that receiving the first vaccine dose had no impact on the timing of the next menstrual bleed. But after receiving the second, people experienced a small delay – just under half a day on average. This difference had disappeared by the third cycle post vaccine.Mar 1, 2022\nHas anyone had severe reactions to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? Monitoring of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has found 10 cases of anaphylaxis after the administration of 4,041,396 first doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

Yes, depending on your age, you can choose which COVID-19 vaccine to get. For adults ages 18 years and older, the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) are preferred over Johnson \u0026 Johnson’s Janssen (J\u0026J/Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine. You may get J\u0026J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in some situations.Currently, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is the only COVID-19 vaccine available to children ages 5 through 17 years old.Learn more about your COVID-19 vaccination, including how to find a vaccination location, what to expect at your appointment, and more.\nIs it normal that I feel worse after second COVID-19 shot? This is normal and expected, but it doesn’t happen to everyone. Even if you feel worse after the second shot, the side effects should still resolve within a few days.May 3, 2021\nIs the COVID-19 vaccine working if I don t have side effects? Fortunately, there’s no reason to be worried. Just because you didn’t have a reaction – or not much of one – doesn’t mean your body isn’t mounting a response to the vaccine. The reality is that not everyone has a reaction. As a matter of fact, studies show only about 50% of patients experience side effects.May 18, 2021\nHow do I know if I’ve been fully vaccinated if I was vaccinated in another country? If you have received all recommended doses of a COVID-19 vaccine that has been authorized or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or is listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO), then you are considered to be fully vaccinated.\nHow do I transfer my proof of vaccination from another country to get a proof of vaccination card in the United States?

To update your records with vaccines you received while outside of the United States, you may:Contact the immunization information system (IIS) in your state. You can find state IIS information on the CDC website.Contact your healthcare provider or your local or state immunization program through your state’s health department.The CDC-labeled white COVID-19 Vaccination Record Cards are only issued to people vaccinated in the United States. CDC recommends you keep your documentation of being vaccinated in the other country as proof of vaccination. CDC also recommends checking with your primary care provider or state health department for options to document your vaccination status domestically.\nHow long do COVID-19 vaccines last? It is normal for virus-fighting antibodies—such as those that are stimulated by a COVID-19 vaccine—to wane over time. Monitoring antibody levels in the blood is one way to measure vaccine efficacy and research has found that protection remains high for six months after the second shot of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.May 20, 2022\nCan you transmit COVID-19 while fully vaccinated? While fully vaccinated people are less likely to transmit the coronavirus to unvaccinated people, it is still possible to spread the virus.

Data released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) show that COVID-19 protection from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was demonstrated in the clinical trials at about 14 days after the first shot. The FDA said some level of immunity may start sooner, but how much is not certain.\nWill I have to pay for my COVID-19 test up front? See full answerThe Biden-Harris Administration is strongly incentivizing health plans and insurers to set up a network of convenient locations across the country such as pharmacies or retailers where people with private health coverage will be able to order online or walk in and pick up at-home over-the-counter COVID-19 tests for free, rather than going through the process of having to submit claims for reimbursement. Consumers can find out from their plan or insurer if it provides direct coverage of over-the-counter COVID-19 tests through such a program or whether they will need to submit a claim for reimbursement. If you are charged for your test after January 15, keep your receipt and submit a claim to your insurance company for reimbursement.Jan 12, 2022\nDoes CVS offer COVID-19 testing?
