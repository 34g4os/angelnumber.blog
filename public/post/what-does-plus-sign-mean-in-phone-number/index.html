<p>07 is the prefix used when dialing a British number inside the UK, while +44 is what used when dialing a British number outside the UK. You might ask whether +44 and 07 are the same. This isn&rsquo;t the case. They are two different prefixes used for two different situations.</p>

<p>The plus sign before the country code means &ldquo;add the exit code&rdquo; of the country you are dialing from. So, using the example above, if you were dialing from the US you would replace the plus sign with 011, while, if dialing from one of the numerous countries using exit code 00, you would instead have 00 44 700 000 0000.</p>

<p>+1 is what you add before the 10 digit number in order to call an American number if you&rsquo;re calling from outside of the country. so if someone calls you from a US number, and you save that number to your phone, by default it will have +1 before it.
