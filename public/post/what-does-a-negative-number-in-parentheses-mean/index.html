<p>Parentheses can be removed by multiplying the outside factor to each term inside the parentheses. Example: 5(3x + 8) = 5(3x) + 5(8) = 15x + 40. Note: A negative sign outside parentheses can be understood as the coefficient -1.</p>

<p>Look Out: sometimes you may see parentheses around negative numbers. These do not mean that we need to multiply; they&rsquo;re just used so that we don&rsquo;t confuse negatives with subtraction.</p>

<p>If we have a minus sign before the parentheses then we the signs within the parentheses will change. Two negatives make one positive!</p>

<p>Numbers smaller than zero (shown to the left of zero on the number line in the figure below) are called negative numbers. We indicate they are negative by putting them in brackets as shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>If an equation you need to solve has parentheses, simplify the parentheses (most often using distribution) and then solve as you normally would. Simplify both sides of the equation as much as possible using the order of operations (distribute, combine like terms, etc.).Jan 21, 2019</p>

<p>It means the number is negative. It&rsquo;s an alternate way of showing negative numbers versus prefacing with a negative sign ( - ) In some cases, a negative value also has a different name. For example you&rsquo;ll often see Net Profit (Loss) : (10,000) Where the parentheses means that it was a loss and not a profit.Feb 14, 2019</p>
