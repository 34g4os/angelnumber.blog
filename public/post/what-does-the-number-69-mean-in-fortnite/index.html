Someone or something that is very intense or stressful.\nWhat does each alarm mean in a fire? The number of alarms corresponds to the number of firefighters called to the scene. But there’s no simple relationship between the two. A two-alarm designation doesn’t mean you’re calling in two companies, two brigades, two firehouses, or twice as many people as you would call in for a one-alarm.May 4, 2006\nWhat does 4 alarm fire mean? For example, a code commonly used throughout the US was four rings, a pause, and another four rings (known to fire alarm specialists as “Code 4-4” or simply “4-4”) to indicate a particularly intense fire, giving rise to the phrase “four alarm fire”.\nWhat made 69 famous? The “Gummo” video launched Hernandez on three parallel trajectories — one that made him famous; one that made him notorious; and one that may end his career. “Gummo,” powered by the bizarre, unforgettable 6ix9ine image, was a viral sensation that went platinum in just a few months.Jan 16, 2019\nWhy does 69 call himself that? Back in March, 6ix9ine took to Instagram to discuss his stage name with a series of faux-philosophical messages. “I never lost sense of where I came from. That’s what makes me 69,” he wrote. “The true meaning of 69 is just because you’re right doesn’t mean I’m wrong YOU JUST HAVENT SEEN LIFE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.”Jan 17, 2019\nWhat crimes has 69 done? That means the social media provocateur and short-time Nine Trey Bloods member — with an extensive criminal record of dealing drugs, participating in assaults, using a 13-year-old girl in a sex video he posted online and committing unspecified acts of domestic violence — could soon go free.Dec 6, 2019\n",
