<p>Lesson Summary. Bar notation refers to a horizontal line drawn on repeated numerals. Adding a line over a number makes it easier to write repeated numerals. The terms that keep on repeating are called never-ending terms, also called &lsquo;&lsquo;infinity&rsquo;&rsquo;; the concept of infinity is usually symbolized as a figure-eight sign.Mar 4, 2022</p>
