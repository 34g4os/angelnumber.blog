Draw a number line. 2) Put either an open circle or a closed dot above the number given. For ≤ and ≥ , use a closed dot to indicate the number itself is part of the solution. For \u003c and \u003e, use an open circle to indicate the number itself is not part of the solution. What do open and closed dots mean on a graph? Explanation: An open circle indictes “less than” or “greater than,” while a closed circle indicates “greater than or equal to” or “less than or equal to”.\nWhat does a closed dot mean on a line graph? Draw a number line. 2) Put either an open circle or a closed dot above the number given. For ≤ and ≥ , use a closed dot to indicate the number itself is part of the solution. For \u003c and \u003e, use an open circle to indicate the number itself is not part of the solution. What is the difference between open and closed circles on a line graph? Inequalities on a number line Inequalities can be shown on a number line. Open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (\u003c or \u003e). Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ or ≥).\nWhat does open and close dot mean? We use the open and closed dots to make this distinction. I put a closed dot at the “5” end of the interval to indicate that x = 5 satisfies the inequality, and I put an open dot at the “1” end of the interval to indicate that x = 1 does not satisfy the inequality.\nHow do you know if it is an open or closed circle? Open circles are used for numbers that are less than or greater than (\u003c or \u003e). Closed circles are used for numbers that are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ or ≥).\nWhat does open dot mean on a graph? A solid dot on a number line graph indicates that the given number should be included as a possible solution, whereas an open dot indicates that the given number cannot be a solution. For example, if you graph x \u003e 7, you place an open dot at 7 because it’s not a valid answer (7 is not greater than itself).\nHow do you know if it is an open or closed circle?

For example, if you graph x \u003e 7, you place an open dot at 7 because it’s not a valid answer (7 is not greater than itself).\nWhat does a shaded circle mean on a number line? Representing Inequalities on a Number Line Each of these graphs begins with a circle—either an open or closed (shaded) circle. This point is often called the end point of the solution. A closed, or shaded, circle is used to represent the inequalities greater than or equal to ( ) or less than or equal to ( ).\nWhat does an open dot on a number line mean?
